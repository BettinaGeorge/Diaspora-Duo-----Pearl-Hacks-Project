## ✨ Inspiration

As African immigrants ourselves, we’ve experienced firsthand the challenges of transitioning into a new culture. The isolation, cultural shock, and lack of accessible guidance can be overwhelming — and too often, immigrants face these burdens alone.

In the U.S. alone, over 100,000 immigrants arrive each year, many without the tools they need to truly settle in. We created **Diaspora Duo** to be the helping hand we once wished for — a trustworthy AI buddy that eases this journey by offering personalized, culturally aware support.

## 💡 What It Does

**Diaspora Duo** is an AI-powered web app that helps immigrants and travelers adapt to a new country through:

- 🌐 Tailored travel insights based on their country of origin  
- 📍 Personalized cultural and navigation tips  
- 🗣️ Support in their native language

Our goal is to minimize the “lost phase” and foster a sense of community and connection — no matter where you’re coming from.

## 🛠️ How We Built It

- **Frontend:** HTML + CSS  
- **Backend:** Flask (Python)  
- **AI Integration:** OpenAI API  
- **Design:** Figma + Canva  
- **Development Tools:** VS Code

User input — like country of origin and language — is used to generate culturally relevant information using OpenAI, translated when necessary to the user's language.
