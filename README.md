## ✨ Inspiration

As African immigrants ourselves, we’ve experienced firsthand the challenges of transitioning into a new culture. The isolation, cultural shock, and lack of accessible guidance can be overwhelming — and too often, immigrants face these burdens alone.

In the U.S. alone, over 100,000 immigrants arrive each year, many without the tools they need to truly settle in. We created **Diaspora Duo** to be the helping hand we once wished for — a trustworthy AI buddy that eases this journey by offering personalized, culturally aware support.

## 💡 What It Does

**Diaspora Duo** is an AI-powered web app that helps immigrants and travelers adapt to a new country through:

- 🌐 Tailored travel insights based on their country of origin  
- 📍 Personalized cultural and navigation tips  
- 🗣️ Support in their native language

Our goal is to minimize the “lost phase” and foster a sense of community and connection — no matter where you’re coming from.

## 🛠️ How We Built It

- **Frontend:** HTML + CSS  
- **Backend:** Flask (Python)  
- **AI Integration:** OpenAI API  
- **Design:** Figma + Canva  
- **Development Tools:** VS Code

User input — like country of origin and language — is used to generate culturally relevant information using OpenAI, translated when necessary to the user's language.

## 🚧 Challenges We Ran Into

One major challenge we faced was integrating a functional and meaningful database into our web server. We initially tried using MySQL, but struggled to input and structure the data in a way that supported seamless user interaction.

We also realized how difficult it is to manually collect detailed, culturally nuanced information for users from different parts of the world. This led us to pivot — and leverage AI as our dynamic solution. By integrating OpenAI’s capabilities, we were able to scale the knowledge base in a way we couldn’t with static data.

## 🎉 Accomplishments We're Proud Of

We’re proud to have created more than just a technical project — we created a platform that builds **bridges**, connects **communities**, and provides **access for all**, not just one demographic.

As a team of beginner developers, we combined our unique skills — from design to backend to storytelling — and used AI in a meaningful way to address real-world challenges. Winning two awards from major companies validated the impact of our vision.

## 📚 What We Learned

- Never give up, especially when you're *so* close to a breakthrough.  
- That purpose-driven projects carry you through the hardest challenges.  
- How to use **Flask**, integrate **APIs**, and work with **AI technology**.  
- That collaboration, resilience, and shared lived experience are just as important as code.
